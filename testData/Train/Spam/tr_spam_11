Shown here is Media Matters CEO David Brock. Two left-leaning Washington organizations 
are facing heated criticism for their Israel-related coverage and commentary after throwing 
around the disparaging term "Israel firster" and accusing the Simon Wiesenthal Center 
-- a group dedicated to tolerance -- of being a "far-right" oit.The 
comments by writers for the Center for American Progress, a think tank, 
and Media Matters, a media advocacy group, have received increasing attention over 
the past week, in particular for their criticism of American supporters of 
Israel and for their repeated downplaying of the threat posed by a 
nuclear Iran. The CAP also was reproached for its criticism of the 
Simon Wiesenthal Center as a partisan oit.The Wiesenthal Center responded this week 
with a lengthy statement that condemned the remarks and suggested that the 
organizations are trying to make it difficult for others "to take a 
position sympathetic to the Jewish state."At i
BUDAPEST, Hungary -- One of three Hungarian journalists staging a hunger strike 
said he hopes their protest brings more attention -- and an end 
-- to acts of censorship and increasing government meddling in state-funded media.A 
media law that went into effect in Hungary on Jan. 1 has 
been severely criticized by international observers, and several modifications were made after 
complaints from the European Union because of its potential ability to restrict 
press freedoms.One heavily criticized aspect was the centralization of the state media's 
news service, which eliminated much duplication among Hungarian state radio and TV 
stations, but also led to charges that the government led by Prime 
Minister Viktor Orban wants to keep closer control over its contents."There is 
constant pressure from every government to try to influence public media ... 
but what this current group is doing is unprecedented," said Balazs Nagy 
Navarro, a foreign affairs editor at Hungary's s
test detective can find the clue to salvage the franchise.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">BEIJING -- More than a year and a half after prominent civil 
rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng disappeared, China's government gave the first sign Friday 
that he is alive, saying he would be sent to prison for 
three years for violating his probation.A brief report by the state-run Xinhua 
News Agency did not answer key questions about Gao -- the condition 
of his health and his whereabouts now and in the 20 months 
since he disappeared, presumably at the hands of the authorities."Are they sending 
him to a proper prison? Which prison was he at before? Where 
were they hiding him?" said Gao's brother, Gao Zhiyi, who has been 
on a quest to find his sibling.Gao's wife said from the United 
States she was still uneasy because of the lack of information."When I 
heard what they said, all I could think was 'Oh, it means 
he's still alive,"' Geng He said, crying, in a phone interview with 
The Associated Press.Charismatic and pugnacious, Gao was a galvanizing figure for the 
rights
 VATICAN CITY -- Pope Benedict XVI warned Friday that respect for human 
dignity "is seriously threatened" by concerns over profit, utility and material possessions.At 
a time when the economic crisis is causing a "rising sense of 
frustration" in society, young people need to becated on the ethical 
needs for achieving justice and peace, he said.The pope expressed his concerns 
in an annual written message for the church's celebration of its World 
Day of Peace on Jan. 1, saying "it seems as if a 
shadow has fallen over our time, preventing us from clearly seeing the 
light of day."But he said he is convinced that the young "with 
their enthusiasm and idealism, can offer new hope to the world."At the 
same time, Benedict urged political leaders to give young people "a transparent 
image of politics as a genuine service to the good of all."He 
said that despite "the profession of good intentions, the value of the 
person, of human dignity and human rights is seriously t
