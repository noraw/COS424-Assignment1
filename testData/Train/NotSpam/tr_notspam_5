Please let me know if you have any feedback to Jay's suggested approach to the
Generation Interconnection Procres section of the tariff.  I don't want to
file this until I hear that you are in agreement.

Mary, Christi.

Thanks for your good comments on the draft interconnection procres.
Attached is a memo addressing your comments.

Michele Farrell will have the pen to make the changes and to supervise the 
filing while I'm out this week.


Jay.

I agree with Dave.  I'd agrue for 120 if I thought I could get away with it.

Frankly, I am more comfortable with 90 days.  Its easier to complete a 
project early and send out the info prior to the due date, then to have to go 
back and ask for more time.  Depending on the size of the plant and location, 
we may be faced with a lot of checking equipment records and field checks to 
verify ratings.  I'll ask Gary Lindland how he feels about rcing the time 
line.

Any feedback on 's comments on our draft interconnection procres that 
Jay sent out last night?  Jay and I are trying to get the DC attorneys on the 
phone to incorporate some changes.  In particular,  wants us to put in a 
shorter time for completing the Interconnection Facilities study (60 rather 
than 90 days).   says we would still have the flexibility to take longer 
if we notify the customer that we need more time.  How do Dave and Jim feel 
about that proposal?
