To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling  stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as  Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.   and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of 's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And  made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of  stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by 's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

mary neff
